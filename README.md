# üçï Crazy Pizzaria
**Optimal Strategy & Simulation Suite**

Welcome to **Crazy Pizzaria**, a computational framework for simulating, analyzing, and mastering the chaotic, luck-filled strategy of the tabletop game *Crazy Pizzaria*. Whether you're a data scientist, a game theorist, or just a pizza lover with a competitive streak ‚Äî this project is for you.

## üéØ Project Goals

- üß† Build a faithful and extensible simulation engine
- ü§ñ Train intelligent agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
- üìä Visualize and interpret strategic insights from high-volume simulations
- üìö Provide both human-readable and machine-usable strategy guides
- üéÆ Support a real-time GUI for interactive game observation

## üìÅ Project Structure

| Folder        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `engine/`     | Core game logic and simulation framework |
| `env/`        | PettingZoo-compatible MARL environment |
| `agents/`     | Reinforcement learning agents and training scripts |
| `gui/`        | Optional GUI (Pygame or Tkinter) for visualization |
| `scripts/`    | One-off runnable Python scripts for testing, demos, and diagnostics |
| `data/`       | Simulation outputs, logs, and trained models |
| `strategy/`   | Extracted strategic insights (e.g., decision trees, policy files) |
| `notebooks/`  | Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experimentation |
| `tests/`      | Unit and behavior tests for code validation |

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AndreKoraleski/crazy-pizzaria-optimal-strategy.git
    cd crazy-pizzaria-optimal-strategy
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment and install dependencies:**
    This project is configured as an installable Python package. From the root directory, run:
    ```sh
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This command uses the `setup.py` file to install all required dependencies and makes the project's `engine` module correctly importable in your environment. The `-e` flag installs it in "editable" mode, so your code changes take effect immediately.

3.  **Run a test simulation:**
    After installation, you can run a sample game using the convenient command-line script:
    ```sh
    # Run with --n 2, 3 or 6 (default 3) 
    # for different player combinations
    run-random-pizzaria-game
    ```
    Alternatively, you can always execute the script directly:
    ```sh
    python3 scripts/test_random_game.py
    ```

## üß™ Running Tests

This project uses `pytest` to validate the core logic of the simulation engine. Tests cover game initialization, turn flow, space resolution, and luck card effects.

To run the full test suite, execute the following command in the root directory:
```sh
pytest
```

### 5. Setup

1. Place the board and ingredient tokens.
2. Lay out all 6 Pizza Recipe cards face up.
3. Players draft recipe cards based on player count:
    - **6 players**: 1 card each
    - **3 players**: 2 cards each, snake order (P1, P2, P3, P3, P2, P1)
    - **2 players**: 3 cards each, full snake (P1, P2, P2, P1, P1, P2)
4. Shuffle the Luck Deck and place it face down.
5. Place the Shared Pawn on a random board space.

### 6. Gameplay

On your turn:

1. Roll the die (1‚Äì6).
2. Move the Shared Pawn clockwise.
3. Perform the action of the space ‚Äî applies only to you.
4. Check if you‚Äôve completed all your recipes. If yes, you win!

### 7. Board Space Effects

- **Ingredient Space**: Take that ingredient if you need it.
- **Chef**: Take any one needed ingredient of your choice.
- **Good or Bad Luck**: Draw and resolve a Luck Card.
